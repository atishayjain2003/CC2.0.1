# CC2.0.1
What is Happening for understanding?
1. Patient data is being admitted succcessfully into the system
2. Transition to other bucket is being shown
3. We are also able to track the history, like the patient was in A1 now he should be in B1 , this is done

What needs to be done?
1. Create database for different substages such that patient data lies in databases of substages
2. Make sure transition of patient can be verified

New changes ?
1. Suppose we have a patient data , according to json structure it should now be moved to Follow UP stage in cohort A.
2. Routing for that is fixed. The patient is getting saved in Follow UP stage.
3. We now need to define it for every other bucket and it will be done

Development?
1. Patient Data is now being saved after transition

*Important*
1. The system now needs excessive testing to rule out any erros that might be present
